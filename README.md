# whizzy_scripts

Whizzy little scripts I write for fun, mostly to help with research, in 
Python 2.7. 

Scientific modules imported in the scripts, as well as python 2.7, can be 
downloaded in the [Anaconda package]
(https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).


## Contents

### 2x.py
Take 2 to the power of x. Just because I can.

### clean_ports.py
Selfupdates macports, checks for inactive ports, and uninstalls inactive ports. 
Note that this program assumes that macports is installed. I don't know what 
would happen if you tried to run this without having macports installed.

### dump_columns.py
Dumps two columns from a FITS file into an ASCII/txt/dat file. You shouldn't
actually use this, since you will lose float precision when switching from a 
binary file format to an ASCII file format. Like the HEASOFT FTOOL fdump, but 
in python!

### fits_info.py
Prints HDU information, extension 1 header keywords, and extension 1 column 
names for a given FITS file. Using extension 1 here for RXTE event-mode data.

### get_keyword.py
Gets the value of a keyword from a FITS header. Like the HEASOFT FTOOL fkeypar, 
but in python!

### obs_epoch_rxte.py
Determines the observational epoch of a specific RXTE observation. Be careful 
with this one, it's barely tested.

### total_obs_time.py
Computes the total observation time for a list of FITS observation files.

### tools.py
Centralized helper methods to import and call within another function:

* **get_key_val** can get the value of a keyword from a FITS header (like 
fkeypar); 
* **compute_obs_time** computes the total observation time in seconds of a list
of observation FITS files; 
* **read_obs_time** reads the observation time from the text header; 
* **power_of_two** checks is an integer is a power of two; 
* **pairwise** allows you to get the next two items of an iterable; 
* **replace_key_val** replaces the value of a keyword in a FITS header (like 
fparkey); 
* **time_ordered_list** takes a list of files and prints them in order of 
ascending start time (from the FITS header keyword TSTART);
* **obs_epoch_rxte** determines which RXTE calibration epoch an observation was
taken during;
* **type_positive_float** is an argparse type that checks if the input is a 
positive float;
* **type_power_of_two** is an argparse type that checks if the input is an 
integer power of two.
